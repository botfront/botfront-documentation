# Setup

### Requirements

Botfront has a few requirements. Please head to [Installing requirements](/docs/getting-started/install-requirements) if you don't have Node or Docker installed

- Linux or macOS (Windows may work but is not officially supported yet, [help is welcome](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/issues/115))
- Chrome (some issues with other browsers)
- A recent version of Docker
- A recent version of Node.js

### Install the Botfront CLI

```bash
npm install -g botfront
```

### Create a new project

```bash
botfront init
```

Botfront will prompt you for a folder name if the current directory is not empty

### Start Botfront

```bash
botfront up
```

When installation is completed, Botfront will propose you to create your first project.

At any time, you can access the Botfront menu to create or run a project by running `botfront` in your shell.

### Setup your project

<video autoplay muted loop width="740" controls>
  <source src="../../videos/setup.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

You can also [install Botfront on a remote server](/deployment/installation/#single-server)
