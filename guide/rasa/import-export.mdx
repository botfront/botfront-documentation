Once you have imported your files your stories will be accessible in the visual story editor.

# Export to Rasa or Rasa X

You can export the conversations created with Botfront to an existing Rasa / Rasa X project.
Head to the Settings menu (left sidebar), select **Import/Export**, and choose Rasa / Rasa X.

<Important type="tip">
When you export a project, links and branches are preserved in the `md` files so you can re-import these files and keep your nicely orgni.
</Important>

You will get a zip file containing all the files required files:

```
awesome-project
|- data/
|--- nlu.md
|--- stories.md
|- config.yml
|- credentials.yml
|- domains.yml
|- endpoints.yml
```

A few things to keep in mind:

#### NLU

Consider removing Botfront specific NLU components, such as `rasa_addons.nlu.components.gazette.Gazette`.

#### Credentials and endpoints

You probably don't need to change them, or if you need to keep credentials from Botfront, be sure to keep the `rasa` and `rest` fields from the `credentials.yml` provided by Rasa X.
