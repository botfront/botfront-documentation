# Slot filling

Stories are great to model linear conversation flows.
However, a common use case is to collect a certain amount of information and do something with that information once it is collected.
This of a form on a web page.

In a conversation, each form field will be a conversation turn.
The assistant will ask a question, and the user will utter a response (or click on a button).
This response (or some derivative) will be stored in slots. 
Once all the slots are collected, we can continue the conversation, knowing that we have all the required information to proceed.

## Creating our form
You can create a form from clicking the + button at the top of the sidebar, choose a name and a description.
Then you can select the slots you want this form to fill. Note you must have created the slots first. [See here how to create your slots](/todo).

## Configure slots

### Setting the question

Note that the content of your question will be lost if you change its type.

### Validation

### Filling

This is where you define how to fill the value of the slot from the user response.



## Test
Let's start with a simple use case. We ask a user their first and last name, and expect their response to be valid.
We are going to collect information from users and store it in slots. See [this section]() for more information on slots.

When creating a form, we need to specify which slots we need to fill. 
The first thing we need to do is declare our slots:

The next step is to incorporate slot filling on our stories
