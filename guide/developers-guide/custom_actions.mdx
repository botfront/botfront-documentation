# Custom actions

## Development

Botfront makes Rasa custom actions. Writing and using custom actions is very easy.

In your project you should have the following folders:

| Folder        | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `.botfront`   | Project configuration files, docker-compose files |
| `actions`     | Custom actions for the actions server             |
| `botfront-db` | MongoDB persisted files                           |
| `models`      | Persisted models                                  |
| `rasa`        | Rasa image material                               |

You probably figured it out: `actions` is our folder of interest.

#### Launch the watcher

The first thing to do is to launch the watcher. Symply run `botfront watch` from the root of your project. Any change in the `actions` folder will rebuild and restart the actions server so you can test the actions in Botfront

#### Write custom actions

All actions in the `actions` folder will be found by the watcher. You can add actions to the default `my_actions.py` file or add new files.

<Important type="tip" title="Importing modules in your actions">

Your imports must include `actions`. If you want to import a module in the `actions` folder:

```python
import actions.my_module
```

</Important>

#### Verify that your actions are registered

Run `botfront logs` and verify that your actions are correctly imported. You should see something like `INFO:rasa_sdk.executor:Registered function for 'action_guests'.` for each action in the folder.

#### Add your action to the conversation

From the [conversation builder guide](/docs/rasa/conversation-builder/#actions), add your action to the conversation.

## Deployment

You can build your action server Docker image with the `Dockerfile.production` in the `actions` folder of your project.
