# Engage with users based on browsing behavior

**Use case example**: an insurance company have a special offer for customers subscribing a bundled home and car policy.
They want to engage with users browsing both _home insurance_ and _car insurance_ product pages.

You can do that by creating a trigger with browsing history:

<video autoplay muted loop width="100%" controls>
  <source src="../../videos/triggers_browsing_history.m4v" type="video/mp4"/>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<Important type="tip" title="Stories with triggers do not need to start with a user message">
Since trigger stories are initiated by the virtual assistant, they can start with a bot <i>response</i>.
However, if you want to make the same story accessible from a user message you can start it with a user utterance or payload.
</Important>

## Enforce a sequence

The example above does not require that pages are visited in a particular order. We are simply looking for an interest in both products.
If order matters to you, check this option:
![](../../images/proactive_conversations/trigger_sequence.png)

## Partial or full match

By default, all subsequent paths will be matched. For example, the url `.../policies/home/condos` would activate the trigger.
If you don't want that you can uncheck this option:
![](../../images/proactive_conversations/triggers_subsequent.png)


## Protocol, host, and port
Protocol, host, and port are always ignored. Which means that if you set `http://localhost:8000/product/features` it will also match `https://yoursite.com/product/features`.

## Engage with returning visitors

**Example use case**: visitors returning several times on the _pricing_ page of a Saas company might be interested in scheduling a demo.

The following video shows how to engage with a user coming on [https://botfront.io/pricing](https://botfront.io/pricing) for the third time, after staying 15 seconds on the page:

<video autoplay muted loop width="100%" controls>
  <source src="../../videos/triggers_returning.m4v" type="video/mp4"/>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<Important type="info" title="Number of page visits vs. website visits.">
If you set <strong>3</strong> website visits, the assistant will engage at the third visit regardless of the page.{' '}
If you set <strong>3</strong> page visits without specifying a URL, the assistant will engage everytime you visit a page on the site for the third time.
</Important>
