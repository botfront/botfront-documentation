## Reach out to users based on their behaviour on your website

Botfront lets you define and combine behavioral conditions that will trigger a specific conversation.
Here are a few examples of such conditions:

- A user has visited a particular combination of URLs, in a given order or not.
- A user has returned on the website or on a specific page a certain number of times. Or a user has visited a combination of pages a certain number of times.
- A user has reached a particular section on a page
- A user is on a page for a certain amount of time

A simple example is reaching out to visitors returning to the _pricing_ page.
